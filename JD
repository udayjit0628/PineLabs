Madam, it’s a good company offer, but currently I have only one offer, so I can’t share it right now.
Once my selection is completed, I will share the offer letter with you.

Yes, just a moment. I’m sharing my screen now
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good morning/afternoon,

“My name is Udayjit Charpe, and I’m a DevOps Engineer with 2.7 years of experience at Tech Mahindra.

Currently, I work on cloud-based applications on AWS, and I focus on automating build and deployment 
processes to make releases smooth and reliable. On a daily basis, I work with Linux servers, collaborate 
with development teams using GitHub, and maintain CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins.

I also handle build automation with Maven, configuration management with Ansible, and containerization 
using Docker. I’ve gained hands-on exposure to Kubernetes for deployments and Terraform for provisioning
infrastructure. I’ve also worked a bit with Azure DevOps for pipelines and repository management.

What I enjoy most is automation and continuous improvement, and I like working in teams where I can 
learn and grow. My experience at Tech Mahindra has helped me build both technical skills and teamwork 
abilities, and I’m excited to take on more responsibilities and challenges in my career.”

Thank you.

Q: Tell me about your current/previous project and your role?

ans - : 
I worked on the HORIZON project for Vodafone Idea as a DevOps Engineer. My main focus was on automating 
CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, which cut down manual deployment work by around 30%. I containerized 
applications with Docker and deployed them on Kubernetes to make deployments more stable.

I also automated environment setup using Terraform, which reduced setup time by about 40%, 
and managed AWS services like EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, RDS, and Load Balancers.

For configuration, I used Ansible playbooks to minimize errors, and integrated SonarQube to improve 
code quality. I set up CloudWatch monitoring and alerts to catch issues faster.

I worked closely with the Dev and QA teams to make sure deployments ran smoothly. Overall, my role was
all about automation, reliable deployments, and building scalable infrastructure.”

1️⃣ CI/CD & Jenkins

Q1: Tell me about a CI/CD pipeline you built.
Ans-: 
I built Jenkins pipelines for HORIZON. Basically, when someone commits code to Git, it triggers Maven 
build, SonarQube checks, Docker image is created, pushed to AWS ECR, and deployed using Helm/Kubernetes. 
It reduced manual deployment by around 30%.”

Q2: What do you do if a build fails?
Ans-:
I first check the Jenkins logs to see where it failed. If it’s a code issue, I coordinate with the dev team.
If it’s environment or config, I fix it and redeploy.”

Q3: How do you handle multiple environments?
Ans-: 
I keep separate Helm values files for dev, QA, and prod. Jenkins picks the correct one automatically, 
so deployment is consistent.”

Q4: How do you ensure code quality?
Ans-: 
I integrated SonarQube in the pipeline, which helped catch issues early and reduced build failures by 25%.”

2️⃣ Docker / Containerization

Q5: How did you use Docker in your project?
Ans-: 
I containerized all microservices so that dev, QA, and prod environments are the same. It made deployments
smoother and more reliable.”

Q6: What if a container doesn’t start?
Ans-: 
I check docker logs to see errors, verify environment variables and volumes, fix the issue, and redeploy. 
For example, in HORIZON a missing config file caused a pod to fail, which I fixed this way.”

Q7: What benefits did Docker give?
Ans-: 
It ensured consistent environment across stages, faster deployments, and fewer issues in production.”

3️⃣ Kubernetes (Basic Exposure)

Q8: What’s your experience with Kubernetes?
Ans-: 
I deployed Docker containers on Kubernetes clusters, monitored pod health, and handled rolling updates. 
My hands-on exposure is basic but mainly focused on deployment and monitoring.”

Q9: How do you troubleshoot a failing pod?
Ans-: 
I use kubectl logs and kubectl describe pod to check errors. In one case, a pod failed due to an 
environment mismatch; I updated the Helm chart and redeployed.”

Q10: What is Helm and why do you use it?
Ans-: 
Helm is like a package manager for Kubernetes. It helps deploy apps consistently across dev, QA, and prod.”

4️⃣ AWS / Cloud

Q11: Which AWS services have you used?
Ans-: 
I’ve worked with EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, RDS, Load Balancers, ECR, CodePipeline, and CloudWatch. 
I managed scaling, security, and deployments.”

Q12: How do you monitor application health?
Ans-: 
I use CloudWatch and Grafana dashboards to monitor CPU, memory, latency, and errors. 
This helped reduce issue detection time by 20%.”

Q13: How did you automate infrastructure?
Ans-: 
I used Terraform to automate environment setup, which reduced provisioning time by around 40%.”

5️⃣ Configuration / Automation

Q14: How did you manage configuration?
Ans-: 
I wrote Ansible playbooks to automate configuration updates. This cut configuration errors by 50%.”

Q15: How do you handle environment-related deployment issues?
Ans: 
I check scripts, Docker images, Helm charts, and AWS configs. Then coordinate with Dev/QA to fix and redeploy.”

6️⃣ Troubleshooting / Scenario

Q16: A production pod crashes. What do you do?
Ans-: 
Check logs, environment variables, Helm chart. Fix the issue, redeploy, and keep rollback ready if needed.”

Q17: Service is slow in production. How do you troubleshoot?
Ans-: 
I check pod metrics, CPU/memory usage, logs, DB queries, and network. In HORIZON, latency was 
due to inefficient DB queries; I optimized them.”

Q18: CI/CD pipeline fails, what’s your approach?
Ans-: 
I check logs, Docker, Helm, environment, fix the issue, rebuild, and redeploy.”

7️⃣ Collaboration / Behavioral

Q19: How do you work with Dev and QA teams?
Ans-: 
I coordinate during sprints, maintain stable CI/CD pipelines, prepare QA environments, 
and communicate deployment changes.”

Q20: Give an example of a production issue you solved.
Ans-: 
One pod crashed due to a wrong environment variable. I updated the Helm chart, redeployed, 
and added validation to the pipeline to prevent this again.”

Q21: How do you manage multiple deployment priorities?
Ans-: 
I check impact and urgency, communicate with teams, and follow a structured deployment plan to avoid downtime.”

8️⃣ Scripting / OS / Networking

Q22: Which scripting languages do you know?
Ans-: 
Shell scripting and basic Python. I use them for automation, log parsing, and CI/CD tasks.”

Q23: TCP vs UDP?
Ans-:
“TCP is reliable and connection-oriented, UDP is faster but less reliable.”

Q24: Linux commands for monitoring?
Ans-:
“I use top, htop, df -h, netstat, and tail -f /var/log.”

Q25: Difference between CI/CD, DevOps, and IaC?
Ans-: 
“CI/CD automates build, test, and deploy. DevOps is a culture for collaboration. IaC
like Terraform automates infrastructure provisioning.”
