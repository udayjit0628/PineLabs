Thank you.

Q: Tell me about your current/previous project and your role?

ans - : 
I worked on the HORIZON project for Vodafone Idea as a DevOps Engineer. My main focus was on automating 
CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, which cut down manual deployment work by around 30%. I containerized 
applications with Docker and deployed them on Kubernetes to make deployments more stable.

I also automated environment setup using Terraform, which reduced setup time by about 40%, 
and managed AWS services like EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, RDS, and Load Balancers.

For configuration, I used Ansible playbooks to minimize errors, and integrated SonarQube to improve 
code quality. I set up CloudWatch monitoring and alerts to catch issues faster.

I worked closely with the Dev and QA teams to make sure deployments ran smoothly. Overall, my role was
all about automation, reliable deployments, and building scalable infrastructure.”

1️⃣ CI/CD & Jenkins

Q1: Tell me about a CI/CD pipeline you built.
Ans-: 
I built Jenkins pipelines for HORIZON. Basically, when someone commits code to Git, it triggers Maven 
build, SonarQube checks, Docker image is created, pushed to AWS ECR, and deployed using Helm/Kubernetes. 
It reduced manual deployment by around 30%.”

Q2: What do you do if a build fails?
Ans-:
I first check the Jenkins logs to see where it failed. If it’s a code issue, I coordinate with the dev team.
If it’s environment or config, I fix it and redeploy.”

Q3: How do you handle multiple environments?
Ans-: 
I keep separate Helm values files for dev, QA, and prod. Jenkins picks the correct one automatically, 
so deployment is consistent.”

Q4: How do you ensure code quality?
Ans-: 
I integrated SonarQube in the pipeline, which helped catch issues early and reduced build failures by 25%.”

2️⃣ Docker / Containerization

Q5: How did you use Docker in your project?
Ans-: 
I containerized all microservices so that dev, QA, and prod environments are the same. It made deployments
smoother and more reliable.”

Q6: What if a container doesn’t start?
Ans-: 
I check docker logs to see errors, verify environment variables and volumes, fix the issue, and redeploy. 
For example, in HORIZON a missing config file caused a pod to fail, which I fixed this way.”

Q7: What benefits did Docker give?
Ans-: 
It ensured consistent environment across stages, faster deployments, and fewer issues in production.”

3️⃣ Kubernetes (Basic Exposure)

Q8: What’s your experience with Kubernetes?
Ans-: 
I deployed Docker containers on Kubernetes clusters, monitored pod health, and handled rolling updates. 
My hands-on exposure is basic but mainly focused on deployment and monitoring.”

Q9: How do you troubleshoot a failing pod?
Ans-: 
I use kubectl logs and kubectl describe pod to check errors. In one case, a pod failed due to an 
environment mismatch; I updated the Helm chart and redeployed.”

Q10: What is Helm and why do you use it?
Ans-: 
Helm is like a package manager for Kubernetes. It helps deploy apps consistently across dev, QA, and prod.”

4️⃣ AWS / Cloud

Q11: Which AWS services have you used?
Ans-: 
I’ve worked with EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, RDS, Load Balancers, ECR, CodePipeline, and CloudWatch. 
I managed scaling, security, and deployments.”

Q12: How do you monitor application health?
Ans-: 
I use CloudWatch and Grafana dashboards to monitor CPU, memory, latency, and errors. 
This helped reduce issue detection time by 20%.”

Q13: How did you automate infrastructure?
Ans-: 
I used Terraform to automate environment setup, which reduced provisioning time by around 40%.”

5️⃣ Configuration / Automation

Q14: How did you manage configuration?
Ans-: 
I wrote Ansible playbooks to automate configuration updates. This cut configuration errors by 50%.”

Q15: How do you handle environment-related deployment issues?
Ans: 
I check scripts, Docker images, Helm charts, and AWS configs. Then coordinate with Dev/QA to fix and redeploy.”

6️⃣ Troubleshooting / Scenario

Q16: A production pod crashes. What do you do?
Ans-: 
Check logs, environment variables, Helm chart. Fix the issue, redeploy, and keep rollback ready if needed.”

Q17: Service is slow in production. How do you troubleshoot?
Ans-: 
I check pod metrics, CPU/memory usage, logs, DB queries, and network. In HORIZON, latency was 
due to inefficient DB queries; I optimized them.”

Q18: CI/CD pipeline fails, what’s your approach?
Ans-: 
I check logs, Docker, Helm, environment, fix the issue, rebuild, and redeploy.”

7️⃣ Collaboration / Behavioral

Q19: How do you work with Dev and QA teams?
Ans-: 
I coordinate during sprints, maintain stable CI/CD pipelines, prepare QA environments, 
and communicate deployment changes.”

Q20: Give an example of a production issue you solved.
Ans-: 
One pod crashed due to a wrong environment variable. I updated the Helm chart, redeployed, 
and added validation to the pipeline to prevent this again.”

Q21: How do you manage multiple deployment priorities?
Ans-: 
I check impact and urgency, communicate with teams, and follow a structured deployment plan to avoid downtime.”

8️⃣ Scripting / OS / Networking

Q22: Which scripting languages do you know?
